# Discriminant Functions for the Normal Density
> Artificial Intelligence

Discriminant analysis works by creating one or more linear combinations of predictors, creating a new latent variable for each function. These functions are called discriminant functions. The number of functions possible is either Ng-1 where Ng = number of groups, or p (the number of predictors), whichever is smaller.

## Cases:
- Case 1: Σi = σ2I
- Case 2: Σi = Σ
- Case 3: Σi = arbitrary
